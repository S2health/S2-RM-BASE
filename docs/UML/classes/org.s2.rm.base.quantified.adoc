h|*0..1*
|*precision*: `<<_integer_class,Integer>>`
a|Precision to which the value of the quantity is expressed, in terms of number of decimal places. The value 0 implies an integral quantity.

The value -1 implies no limit, i.e. any number of decimal places.

Precision can be set to 0 to ensure there are not decimal points, which may be useful on fields that are normally only reported as integers, e.g. blood pressure.
