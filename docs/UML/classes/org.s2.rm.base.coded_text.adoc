h|*Class*
2+^h|*Coded_text*

h|*Description*
2+a|A text item whose string value is a rubric from a controlled terminology, and whose code is given by `_concept_`. The `_value_` may be a 'preferred term' (where this concept is supported by the terminology), or another term. In the latter case, a/the preferred term may be included in the `_mappings_`.

Since `Coded_text` is a subtype of `Text`, it can be used in place of it, effectively allowing the type `Text` to mean  a text item, which may optionally be coded.

If `_formatting_` is present it is limited to `markdown` and may consist only of emphasis and / or hyperlink of the whole `_value_`.
