h|*Class*
2+^h|*Coded_text*

h|*Description*
2+a|A text item whose string value is a rubric from a controlled terminology, and whose code is given by `_concept_`.

Since `Coded_text` is a subtype of `Text`, it can be used in place of it, effectively allowing the type `Text` to mean  a text item, which may optionally be coded.

Misuse: If the intention is to represent a term code attached in some way to a fragment of plain text, `Coded_text` should not be used; instead use a `Text` and a `Term_mapping` to a `Terminology_term`.
