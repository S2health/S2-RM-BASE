a|Normative code defining the ontological taxonomic entity that the information in the sub-tree starting at this node relates to, or 'is about'.

Examples: heart rate, creatinine in urine, date first recognized.This code may be pre-coordinated to include relevant meaning modifiers e.g. 'average heart rate', 'maximum heart rate' in such a way that only comparable information objects are marked with the same code.

NOTE: not to be separately constrained in archetypes; this rule needs to be implemented in archetype tools.

h|*0..1*
|*original_code*: `<<_terminology_term_class,Terminology_term>>`
