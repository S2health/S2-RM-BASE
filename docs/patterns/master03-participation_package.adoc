== Design Principles

=== Referring to External Entities

External demographic parties (individuals, institutions, other autonomous entities) may be referenced from {product_name} platform data either via a direct `Entity_ref_node` reference, or via a _participation_ object. The former indicates the entity, with the kind of participation being known, while the latter additionally enables representation of the type of participation.
