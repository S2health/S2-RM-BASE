= Overview

As described in the Architecture Overview document, formal version control and change management are used in openEHR to support the construction of EHR and other repositories requiring the properties of consistency, indelibility, traceability and distributed sharing. The `change_control` package supplies the formal specification of these features in openEHR. 

<<change_control_package>> illustrates the openEHR model of a Versioned object, and its constituent Versions. In this model, an instance of the class `VERSIONED_OBJECT<T>` provides the versioning facilities for one versioned item and is often referred to as a 'version container'. Although any kind of data can be versioned according to the model presented here, the use of versioning in openEHR is limited to 'top-level structures', such as EHR Compositions and Party objects in a demographic system.

<<version_control_structures>> illustrates a single `VERSIONED_OBJECT` containing a number of `VERSIONs`. Although the figure implies physical containment of Versions by a Versioned object, this is only one possible implementation. Other implementations (e.g. using orthodox relational structures) might use references, separate compressed copies, or any other mechanism.

== Basic Semantics

=== Typing

The classes `VERSIONED_OBJECT<T>`, `VERSION<T>`, `ORIGINAL_VERSION<T>` and `IMPORTED_VERSION<T>` are generic classes, with the generic parameter type T being the type of the data. This ensures that all versions in a given `VERSIONED_OBJECT` are of the same type, such as `COMPOSITION`, `FOLDER`, or `PARTY` and that the version container itself is properly typed.

=== Versioned Objects

Each `VERSIONED_OBJECT` has a unique identifier recorded in the `_uid_` attribute (a `HIER_OBJECT_ID` typically containing a GUID), and a reference to the owning object (e.g. the owning EHR) in the `_owner_id_` attribute (this is typically also a GUID). The latter helps ensure that in storage systems, Versioned objects are always correctly allocated to their enclosing repository, such as an EHR.

The data in a `VERSIONED_OBJECT` are in the form of a collection of instances of the two `VERSION<T>` subtypes, and are available only via the functional interface of `VERSIONED_OBJECT`. How the representation of this collection is implemented inside the `VERSIONED_OBJECT` is not defined by this specification, only the form of any given version is. Implementations of `VERSIONED_OBJECT` might range from the simple (all versions stored as full copies in a list) to a sophisticated compressed versioning approach as used in software file version control and some object databases. (The persistent data format of implementations of `VERSIONED_OBJECT` developed by different organisations will in general be incompatible. For purposes of sharing, an interoperable expression of `VERSIONED_OBJECT` is defined by the `X_VERSIONED_OBJECT` class in the EHR Extract IM.)

=== Version and its Subtypes

Within a Versioned object, each version is an instance of a subtype of the class `VERSION<T>`. The abstract `VERSION` class defines the generic notion of a version containing some data, that has been committed to the repository as a member of a Contribution. Accordingly, it records the Contribution in the `_contribution_` attribute and the audit in `_commit_audit_`. A Version also knows its position in the version tree within the container. It has a version identifier, `_uid_`, and knows on which version in the tree it was based (i.e. what version was checked out to create the current version), `_preceding_version_uid_` (Void if it is the first version). Both of these identifiers are globally unique (see {openehr_base_types}#_identification_package[`base_types.identification` package] in the BASE component). These properties are abstract in the `VERSION` class, since they are defined as being stored or computed respectively in its subtypes.

All Versions in a given version container have a `_uid_` that includes the `_uid_` of the container; in other words, the `_uid_` of a Version is its container's `_uid_` plus further version identification for that particular version with respect to others in the same container. The `VERSION`.`_owner_id_` function extracts the `_uid_` field of the owning `VERSIONED_OBJECT` from the `_uid_` of the `VERSION`.

The `VERSION` class has two subtypes. The first, `ORIGINAL_VERSION<T>`, represents a Version created with original content (stored form of data property) at the time of creation (including from non-openEHR local feeder systems), and potentially attested (signed). It includes as attributes the current version (`_uid_`) and the preceding version (`_preceding_version_uid_`). It also knows the lifecycle state of its content. If it was the result of a merge (see <<Version Merging>>) of versions other than the preceding version, the identifiers of these versions will be recorded in the attribute `_other_input_version_uids_`. All instances of `VERSION<T>` in non-distributed openEHR systems will be instances of `ORIGINAL_VERSION<T>`. The `ORIGINAL_VERSION` is also the unit of copying in a distributed environment.

The second subtype is `IMPORTED_VERSION<T>`, and acts as a wrapper of an `ORIGINAL_VERSION<T>`. It has its own contribution and `_commit_audit_` (inherited from `VERSION<T>`), and contains the original version being imported in its `_item_` attribute. Its `_uid_` and `_preceding_version_` are defined as functions, returning the corresponding attribute values from the wrapped `ORIGINAL_VERSION` object (in other words, an `IMPORTED_VERSION` does not have its own version identifier distinct from the version it is wrapping). The semantics of importing are described below in <<Copying>>. <<instance_view_of_versioned_data>> illustrates typical arrangements of `ORIGINAL_VERSION` and `IMPORTED_VERSION` objects within `VERSIONED_OBJECTs`, in turn within an EHR (if this is an EHR system), ultimately within an identified system. The two `VERSIONED_OBJECTs` are shown representing "medications" and "problem list", to give some idea of correspondence of versioning structures to logical data. Star icons represent digital signatures.

=== The 'Virtual Version Tree'

An underlying design concept of the versioning model defined here is known as the 'virtual version tree'. The idea is simple in the abstract. Information is committed to a repository (such as an EHR) in lumps, each lump being the 'data' of one Version. Each Version has its place within a version tree, which in turn is maintained inside a Versioned object. The virtual version tree concept means that any given Versioned object may have numerous copies in various systems, and that the creation of versions in each is done in such a way that all versions so created are in fact compatible with the 'virtual' version tree resulting from the superimposition of the version trees of all copies. This is achieved using simple rules for version identification, described below, and is done to facilitate data sharing. Two very common scenarios are served by the virtual version tree concept:

* longitudinal data that stands as a proxy for the state or situation of the patient such as "Medications" or "Problem list" (persistent Compositions in openEHR) is created and maintained in one or more care delivery organisations, and shared across a larger number of organisations;
* some EHRs in an EHR server in one location are mirrored into one or more other EHR servers (e.g. at care providers where the relevant patients are also treated); the mirroring process requires asynchronous synchronisation between servers to work seamlessly, regardless of the location, time, or author of any data created.

The `_uid_` attribute of the class `VERSIONED_OBJECT<T>` is in fact the Uid of the virtual version tree for a given logical item (such as the "problem list" of a certain patient) - that is to say, the `_uid_` will be the same in all copies of the same Versioned object in a distributed system.

The versioning scheme used in openEHR guarantees that no matter where data are created or copied, there are no inconsistencies due to sharing, and that logical copies are explicitly represented. This is achieved by the design of Version identifiers.

=== Contributions

Since a versioned repository (i.e. a collection of `VERSIONED_OBJECTs`) is by definition indelible, all logical changes including deletions, additions, modifications (including error corrections and content changes), importing and attestations of existing items, are achieved by physically committing new Versions, or for attestations, new Attestation objects to existing Versions. Each logical type of change is achieved as follows:

* _addition of new item_: a new `VERSIONED_OBJECT` is created with a first `ORIGINAL_VERSION` whose data is the new item; the `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code `249|creation|`;
* _deletion of existing item_: a new `ORIGINAL_VERSION` whose data attribute is set to Void is added to an existing `VERSIONED_OBJECT`; the `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code `523|deleted|`;
* _modification of existing item_: a new `ORIGINAL_VERSION` whose data contains the updated form of the item content is added to an existing `VERSIONED_OBJECT`;
** if the change is logically a correction (e.g. of wrongly entered data), the `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code `250|amendment|`;
** if the change is logically a change, addition etc to the content, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code `251|modification|`;
* _import of item_: a new `IMPORTED_VERSION` is created, incorporating the received `ORIGINAL_VERSION`; the `IMPORTED_VERSION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code for `249|creation|`.
* _attestation of item_: a new `ATTESTATION` is added to the attestations list of an existing `ORIGINAL_VERSION`; the `ATTESTATION._commit_audit_._change_type_` is set to the code `666|attestation|`.

In a typical application situation, one or more of the above changes may be committed to a repository as a Contribution. For example during a patient encounter, the following might occur:

* _addition_: a new Composition is created recording the Observations (e.g. physical examination), etc that are made during the Encounter;
* _modification_: the Composition containing the current medications list is updated, due to a prescription being given during the encounter.

These two changes together constitute a logical _change-set_, and would typically be included in the one Contribution. In general, there might be any combination of the logical change types in a single commit by an application, corresponding to a single real-world business event, such as a GP Encounter, although attestations, deletions and corrections will usually be the only change within a Contribution. In every case, regardless of the combination, a `CONTRIBUTION` object will be created, listing the affected `VERSION` objects, and including its own audit object, whose `_change_type_` attribute captures the aggregate of the changes in the Compositions making up its `_versions_`. This may sometimes be approximate, and is not expected to be used as a computable value. Typical values for `CONTRIBUTION._audit_._change_type_`:

* `251|modification|`: this accommodates cases where there is a mixture of creation, deletion, modification that constitute a change of content;
* `250|amendment|`: corresponds to a mixture of amendments and deletions that logically constitute a correction to the content;
* `666|attestation|`: used when the only changes are attestation of one or more of the member versions;
* any code: when all member versions have the same change type, that change type may be used for the Contribution as well.

The list of all Contribution objects for a version repository (such as an EHR) provides a complete history of the change-sets made to the repository and is the basis for performing 'rollback' to access previous informational states of the EHR. Conversely, each Version object contains a reference to the Contribution that caused it to be created.

=== Committal and Audits

Audits are recorded in the form of instances of the class `AUDIT_DETAILS` (`common.generic` package), which defines a set of attributes which form an audit trail, namely `_system_id_`, `_committer_`, `_time_committed_`, `_change_type_`, and `_description_` or its subtype `ATTESTATION`, which adds a number of other attributes (see below). When an `ORIGINAL_VERSION` instance is created locally, the commit_audit attribute contains an audit object recording the local act of committal. However, if the Version being committed does not correspond to local data creation, but instead contains a copy of an `ORIGINAL_VERSION` originally created and commited elsewhere, it is committed locally as an instance of the `IMPORTED_VERSION` class. Both the contribution and commit_audit of the latter object correspond to the local act of committal, while the knowledge of the original Contribution and committal are retained inside the wrapped `ORIGINAL_VERSION` instance. Original versions can be copied any number of times; in each system into which they are imported, an `IMPORTED_VERSION` is created as a wrapper.

This simple scheme ensures that the audit from initial creation - which is the clinically meaningful audit - is preserved no matter how many times the Version is copied to other systems; it also ensures that from the point of view of the version container, the local commit audit and Contribution always correspond to the local act of committal.

The `CONTRIBUTION` class also contains an audit attribute. Whenever a `CONTRIBUTION` is committed, this attribute captures to the time, place and committer of the committal act; these three attributes (`_system_id_`, `_committer_`, `_time_committed_` of `AUDIT_DETAILS`) should be copied into the corresponding attributes of the commit_audit of each `VERSION` included in the `CONTRIBUTION`. This is done to enable sharing of versioned entities independently of which Contributions they were part of.

The `_time_committed_` attribute in both the Contribution and Version audits should reflect the time of committal to an EHR server, i.e. the time of availability to other users in the same system. It should therefore be computed on the server in implementations where the data are created in a separate client context.

In terms of database management, Contributions are similar to nested transactions. An attempt to commit a Contribution should only succeed if each Version and/or Attestation in the Contribution is committed successfully.

=== Digital Signature

At the time of committal of a Version, a digital signature of the object can be made. In this process, a Version object (an `ORIGINAL_VERSION` or `IMPORTED_VERSION`) is serialised into canonical form which is then hashed to produce a digest. If public key or equivalent infrastructure is in place so that users are able to sign content, a digital signature can be created from the hash, using the user's private key. Either way, the result is then radix-64 encoded to create an ASCII string so as to remove or reduce potential problems with subsequent communication. The openPGP standard ensures that the trasformations and algorithms used to create the signature are indicated within it.

The signature can serve two purposes. If only the hashing step is done, the digest acts as a data integrity check, indicating if the data have been tampered with after creation. If the signing step is carried out, it authenticates the user as the author of the content to readers of the content. In a versioned EHR system, it also acts as a non-repudiation measure, since the signature is stored permanently with the data. To circumvent hacking of the data, public notarisation of the signature can be used. The signature, if present, is generated according to the openPGP standard ({rfc4880}[IETF RFC 4880^]), following the process shown below.

[.text-center]
.Version signature (using openPGP)
image::{diagrams_uri}/version_signature.png[id=version_signature, align="center", width=80%]

The serialisation process works by the simple rule of serialising the entire Version object (note that the signature attribute will be Void at this point) into an agreed XML, ODIN or other text format, then applying the subsequent transformations to the serialised data, then writing the digest result back into the signature attribute. If the object to be serialised is an `IMPORTED_VERSION`, the process is the same - all attributes of the object are serialised and then used to generate a signature. The result will be that the `IMPORTED_VERSION` instance will carry its own signature which signifies the act of importing and making available locally an `ORIGINAL_VERSION` from another system.

[.tbd]
*To Be Determined*: The exact serialisation is not yet defined by openEHR, but ODIN might be preferred since it has an unambiguous encoding of object structures, whereas different XML libraries can generate different XML from the same objects.

It should be noted that the signing process here creates a signature of a logical form of the content, not a particular graphical or other directly human interpretable view. Usually the relationship between the data and what is seen on the screen is assumed to be 1:1 in a reliable system. If however the equivalent of a signature of a screen image or other literal form of the data are needed, then the Attestation form of the `_commit_audit_` is needed. This is described below.

One of the most important uses of signatures in openEHR data is likely to be within EHR Extracts, since they can provide an assurance authenticity and integrity of the data to a receiver who has no knowledge of the quality of the processes used in the originating system.

=== Attestation

The `ORIGINAL_VERSION._attestations_` attribute allows attestations to be associated with the data in an original version. Attestations are treated in openEHR as a kind of audit with additional attributes, and are described in detail in the `common.generic` package section of this specification. Any number of attestations to be associated with each Version in a Versioned object. Attestations can be added at any time after committal of the content being attested. They can be used as required by enter prise processes or legislation, and indicate by whom and when the item in question was attested. A digital "proof" is also required, although no assumption is made about the form of such proof.

Attestations may be used in different ways as follows.

* Signing content at committal: for some reason, the information being committed needs to be digitally signed. It may be that sensitive information is to be added to the EHR, e.g. recording the fact of sectioning of a patient under the mental health act, diagnosis of a fatal disease etc, or simply something which the user wants to sign. In this case, `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_` is of type `ATTESTATION` rather than `AUDIT_DETAILS`.
* Marking content for review and signing: data entered and committed by a data-entry person e.g. a secretary, transcriptionist or student need to be reviewed and signed by a senior clinician. Similarly to the above case, this will cause `ORIGINAL_VERSION._commit_audit_` to be of type `ATTESTATION`, but in this case, the Attestation will have its `_is_pending_` flag set True to indicate that attestation is required.
* Post-committal signing: data committed with an Attestation in the is_pending state is reviewed and signed at a later point in tme by an appropriate member of staff. This action will cause an `ATTESTATION` to be added to the `ORIGINAL_VERSION._attestations_` list.

Normally, Attestations refer to the entire version to which they are attached. However, it is possible for an `ATTESTATION` instance to refer to some finer-grained item within the data of the version, such as a single `ENTRY` within a `COMPOSITION`.

When subsequent Versions are added, the existing Attestations can not be assumed to be valid for the new Version, since the nature of an attestation is that it records the witnessing of exactly the content displayed at the time of witnessing.
